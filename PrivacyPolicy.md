# Tracky – Privacy Policy

**Effective Date: *July 1, 2025***

Thank you for choosing **Tracky**.  Your privacy is important to us.  This Privacy Policy explains what information we ("Tracky," "we," "our," or "us") collect, how we use it, and the choices you have.

## 1. About Tracky

Tracky is an iOS habit‑tracking app that stores your habits and widget settings **locally on your device** and in your private iCloud storage (if you have iCloud Backup enabled).  Tracky does **not** send personal data to our servers because we do not operate any servers.

## 2. Information We Collect

| Category                   | Examples                                                                  | Where Stored                                                                                                           |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **User‑Provided Data**     | Habit names, icons, colors, completion history, custom metrics you create | Securely on‑device in Tracky’s app sandbox and in the shared **App Group** container so widgets can read the same data |
| **Diagnostics** (optional) | Anonymous crash reports and usage statistics collected by Apple           | Apple Inc. (if you opt‑in to “Share with App Developers” in iOS settings)                                              |

Tracky does **not**:

* collect email addresses, names, or passwords
* use third‑party analytics or advertising SDKs
* track you across other apps or websites

---

## 3. How We Use Information

We use your information **only** to:

1. Display your habits, statistics, and widgets inside the app and on your home/lock screen.
2. Maintain app functionality (e.g., syncing settings between the main app and its widgets).
3. Improve stability through aggregated, anonymized crash logs supplied by Apple (if you have opted in).

We never sell or rent your personal information.

---

## 4. Data Storage & Security

* All habit data is stored in **UserDefaults** and **App Group** containers protected by iOS sandboxing and the security of your device.
* If you enable iCloud Backup, Apple encrypts your app data in transit and at rest per [Apple’s security documentation](https://support.apple.com/HT202303).
* You can delete all data at any time by deleting the Tracky app; iOS will remove the on‑device database.  (Data already included in an iCloud backup will be removed when that backup ages out or is deleted.)

---

## 5. Your Choices & Rights

* **Opt‑Out of Diagnostics** – Turn off *Share iPhone & Watch Analytics* in **Settings → Privacy & Security → Analytics & Improvements**.
* **Delete Data** – Remove the app from your device.
* **Access & Correction** – Because data never leaves your device, you have full control within the app to view or edit your habits.

---

## 6. Children’s Privacy

Tracky is not directed to children under 13 and does not knowingly collect personal information from children.  If you believe we have inadvertently collected such information, please contact us so we can delete it.

---

## 7. Third‑Party Services

Tracky relies on the following Apple‑provided services, all of which adhere to Apple’s privacy and security standards:

* **iCloud Backup** – Optional device backup storage.
* **WidgetKit** – To display widgets on your device.

No third‑party advertising or analytics frameworks are integrated.

---

## 8. Changes to This Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy to reflect changes to the app or legal requirements.  We will post the revised policy in the app release notes and update the “Effective Date” above.  Continued use of Tracky after changes constitute acceptance of the updated policy.
